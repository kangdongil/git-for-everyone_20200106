Title: Introduction

You think fire moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind.
Like it knows it killed the world once and got a baste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out.
Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out.
Now we took an tath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't.
Urban is lethal but it doesn't hold a flake to man.
